# Problems - Hangman
Iteration 1: The player has one chance to guess the entire word that is chosen randomly from a predefined list.
Notice how we are simplifying the rules of the game. We donâ€™t worry about guessing letters, and the player either survives or dies after just one guess. Importantly, we focus on choosing a random word from a list, and checking if the guessed word matches the chosen word.

Iteration 2: The player can also load different word lists and gets hints for their guesses.

Iteration 3: The player makes guesses one letter at a time until they win or die. We also draw the hangman with each guess so that the player knows how many chances are left.



### To Run

* `python3 hangman.py`
* follow the input prompts to play the game

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_main.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_main.MyTestCase.test_step1`
* _Note_: at the minimum, these (*unedited*) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.

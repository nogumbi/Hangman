# Hangman

Iteration 1: The player has one chance to guess the entire word that is chosen randomly from a predefined list.

Iteration 2: The player can also load different word lists and gets hints for their guesses.

Iteration 3: The player makes guesses one letter at a time until they win or die. We also draw the hangman with each guess so that the player knows how many chances are left.
